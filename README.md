	<h2>INTRO :</h2>
	<p>Geography:
India is bordered by Pakistan to the northwest, China and Nepal to the north, Bhutan to the northeast, and Bangladesh and Myanmar to the east. To the south, it is surrounded by the Indian Ocean. India's landscape varies from the towering Himalayas in the north to the tropical beaches in the south. It also boasts diverse ecosystems, ranging from deserts to dense forests.<br><br>

History:
India has a deep and ancient history that spans thousands of years. It was home to some of the world's earliest urban civilizations, such as the Indus Valley Civilization (circa 3300â€“1300 BCE). The country later saw the rise of great empires such as the Maurya Empire and the Gupta Empire, and was a major center of trade, culture, and intellectual pursuit. Over the centuries, India came under the influence of various rulers and dynasties, including the Mughal Empire.

In the modern era, India was colonized by the British Empire in the 18th century, a period that lasted nearly 200 years. India's struggle for independence, led by figures such as Mahatma Gandhi, culminated in independence in 1947, and the formation of a secular, democratic republic.<br><br>

Government:
India is a parliamentary democratic republic with a system of governance that is a blend of federal and unitary features. The country is headed by a President, while executive power rests with the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers. India's constitution, adopted in 1950, is one of the longest in the world and outlines the rights and duties of citizens, as well as the structure of the government.<br><br>

Culture:
India's cultural diversity is unparalleled, with a multitude of languages, religions, cuisines, and traditions. It is the birthplace of several major world religions, including Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism, and Sikhism. It also has a significant Muslim population, and is home to large Christian, Jewish, and other communities.

The Hindi language, written in the Devanagari script, is the most widely spoken, though there are 22 officially recognized languages, with English also serving as an associate official language.

Indian culture is famous for its art, music, dance, literature, and film. The Bollywood film industry is one of the largest and most influential in the world.<br><br>
